Prerequisites
=============


System Requirements
-------------------

From the nexus website:
* Linux or Windows
* Dual core CPU
* 4GB RAM
* About 10GB of free HDD space

Software
* Oracle JDK 7 64bit *
* Apache Tomcat 7
* Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited
* Hibernate 4 supported database

Remark: If you are running Linux do not use openJDK.

From practise teh following remarks
* running on 2GB of memory is working for a dedicated VPS, with small files
* files are loaded in memory. For transferring larger files, more memory is needed. This can be trial and error.
* running NEXUSe2e with OpenJDK is confirmed to be working
* JCE extension is absolutely necessary. This is already part of OpenJDK
* Tomcat 7 or higher


Software Installation Example
-----------------------------

* CentOS example
* Ubuntu example
* configuring with Windows is working
