===============

Before installing and configuring NEXUSe2e you need to have a system to install it on. NEXUSe2e uses TOMcat as java applet server. 

Steps

1. install a system or virtual machine

2, install the operating system
No special requirements are necessary

3. Install Tomcat

4. Install a frontend webserver
This is not mandatory, but makes life easier for configuring https and in cases multiple accounts need to be configured in NEXUSe2e. Each account need a different external URL, but can point the same NEXUSe2e instance.

5. Configure TLS
